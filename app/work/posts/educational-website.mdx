_NextJs, MongoDB, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, GIT_

I designed and developed a fully functional course website that provides an interactive platform for employees to watch lessons and complete Wordwall quizzes related to their training.

## ðŸ¦¾ Key Features:

- Course Management: A structured course page displaying lessons with titles and descriptions.
- Lesson Page: Integrated Google Drive video previews and Wordwall quizzes for interactive learning.
- Admin Dashboard: Comprehensive course management with the ability to create, update, and delete courses.
- User Management: Admins can manage users efficiently.
- Secure Authentication: Role-based authentication for both frontend and backend routes.
- Multi Language: Users can use the website in two languages (Sinhala, English) and change it whenever they want.
- Responsive Design: Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

This platform was specifically designed to enhance employee training at a clothing manufacturing company, improving productivity by providing structured learning resources. It enables employees to expand their knowledge, assess their progress, and allows administrators to track learning outcomes effectively.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Technologies:

- Full-stack development with Next.js and MongoDB.
