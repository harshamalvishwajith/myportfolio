I collaborated with a 4-member team to develop "Crystal Clean", an online laundry and dry-cleaning service system that enables customers to book services, manage orders, and interact with staff. The platform provides a seamless user experience, allowing both customers and administrators to manage laundry services efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features:

- User Authentication & Role-Based Access: Customers, staff, and administrators have distinct access levels.
- Service Selection & Order Management: Customers can browse, add, and remove services from their cart.
- Feedback & Communication: Users can leave feedback and contact website owners via a messaging system.
- Staff Management: Staff can accept/cancel orders and respond to customer messages.
- Admin Dashboard: Admins can manage user accounts, approve orders, and update services.
- Report Generation: The manager can generate business reports and manage staff salaries.

## üé® My Contributions:

- Designed & Developed Key Pages:
  - Home Page: Welcoming interface with service previews.
  - Login & Register Pages: Secure user authentication system with validation.
  - Administrator Page: Provides an interface for managing users, orders, and services.
  - Order Now Page: Enables customers to place laundry service requests.
  - About Us Page: Company information, contact details, and social media links.

## üß† Key Learnings & Technologies:

- Full-stack web development using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL Workbench, and XAMPP.
- User authentication & database management for handling different access levels.
- Building dynamic and interactive pages to enhance user experience.
- Collaboration & teamwork in a structured software development project.

This project strengthened my skills in front-end and back-end development, database management, and user experience design while working in a collaborative team environment.
