_MERN Stack(MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), TailwindCSS_

I designed and developed a Book Review Web Application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. This platform enables users to browse, add, edit, delete, and search for book reviews, creating an interactive space for book enthusiasts to share their insights.

## ðŸ“š Key Features:

- User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login functionality for managing personal reviews.
- Book Reviews: Users can submit detailed reviews, including:
- Title & Author â€“ Identify the book being reviewed.
- Rating System â€“ A 1 to 5-star rating scale.
- Review Text â€“ A space for users to express their thoughts.
- Date Added â€“ Tracks when the review was submitted.
- Advanced Search Algorithm:
  - Optimized search functionality to quickly filter books by title.
  - Improves user experience by delivering relevant results efficiently.
- Community Engagement: Users can explore book reviews, helping them discover new reads based on community insights.

This application provides a dynamic and efficient platform for book lovers to search, share opinions, and discover new literature through user-generated content.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Technologies:

- Full-stack development using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
