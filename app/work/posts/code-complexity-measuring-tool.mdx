_Java, React, JavaScript_

I collaborated with a 4-member team to develop a Code Complexity Measuring Tool, designed to analyze and evaluate software maintainability using key complexity metrics. This tool provides developers with valuable insights into code structure, performance, and maintainability by integrating Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity, and the Maintainability Index.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features:

- Code Complexity Analysis: Evaluates cyclomatic complexity, time complexity, and logical statement density to assess maintainability.
- Code Maintainability Checker: Calculates the Maintainability Index (MI) using standard software quality metrics.
- LOC & Cyclomatic Complexity Measurement: Helps developers identify redundant or overly complex code.
- Collaborative Dashboard: Enables real-time code reviews and team discussions.
- Visualization & Reporting: Generates intuitive reports with complexity graphs for better decision-making.

## üé® My Contributions:

- UI/UX Design: Designed an intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.
- Customizable Code Maintainability Checker: Implemented an analysis module that calculates LOC, Cyclomatic Complexity, and Maintainability Index.
- Performance Optimization: Ensured efficient parsing and processing of large codebases.

## üß† Key Learnings & Technologies:

- Software Quality Metrics (Cyclomatic Complexity, Maintainability Index, Halstead Metrics).
- Real-time Code Analysis & Visualization for improved maintainability.
- Java, React, and JavaScript for building the system.
- Collaboration & Teamwork in software engineering projects.

This project enhanced my expertise in software quality analysis, UI/UX design, and performance optimization for scalable code analysis tools
