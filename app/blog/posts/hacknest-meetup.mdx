Hello there, stranger! 👋

I'm buzzing with excitement as I write this from the first-ever Hacknest Meetup! It’s a fantastic gathering of developers, all eager to learn, build, and grow together. This event is organized by the Software Engineering Student Community of SLIIT, and let me tell you—it’s a blast!

Today, we’re diving into the world of portfolios, learning how to craft and deploy our very first portfolio sites. It’s all about showcasing our skills and projects, and the vibe is electric!

## What I Learned at the First Hacknest Meetup

Today has been a whirlwind of knowledge, and I’ve picked up some seriously cool skills. Here are my top takeaways:

- 🎨 **Customizing a Next.js Template:** I discovered how to take a Next.js template and make it my own. My portfolio is officially getting a makeover!
- 🚀 **Deploying with GitHub Pages:** I finally figured out how to deploy a website using GitHub Pages—my first site is now live, and it feels incredible!
- 📝 **Writing Blog Posts in MDX:** And guess what? I learned how to write a blog post using MDX! This is going to make sharing my thoughts so much easier and more fun.

## What I Built During the Workshop

I’m excited to share that I built a simple yet stylish portfolio site that showcases my projects and skills. Here’s a little sneak peek:

The workshop has been an amazing experience, filled with laughter, learning, and collaboration. I can’t wait to see how everyone else’s projects turn out!

Until next time, happy coding! 🎉
