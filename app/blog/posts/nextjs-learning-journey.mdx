## Discovering Next.js

Our Institute's Software Engineering Students' Community organized a **HackNest** meetup, where **Pawan Senpura** explained how to create a **portfolio using Next.js** in a very simple and understandable way. Until then, I had built several websites using the **MERN stack**, but after that session, I developed a strong interest in learning **Next.js** because I realized how simple it was.

## Getting Started with Next.js

As **Pawan** suggested, I started learning **Next.js** by reading the documentation provided by the official NextJs site, which provided clear and straightforward guidance. By following the course, I was able to understand how to build a complete **Next.js project**. Since I was already familiar with **React and Node.js**, learning **Next.js** wasn’t too difficult for me.

## First Hands-on Project

However, even after completing the course, I didn’t feel entirely confident in my **Next.js** skills. Around that time, I got an opportunity to build a **website** for my **sister’s internship project**. I decided to apply what I had recently learned and developed the website using \*\*Next.js\*\*, which was a **course website**.

## Building More Projects

Helping out our **peers and friends** with their projects is truly valuable for our **personal development**. I didn’t stop there; I went on to try several more projects with **Next.js**, including my **portfolio website**. The more projects I worked on, the more confident I became, and now I’m no longer afraid to build projects using **Next.js**.

## The Biggest Lesson

The most important lesson I’ve learned is this: **whenever we feel inspired to learn something new, we should start immediately**. But just starting isn’t enough; we must **continue**. It’s not enough to just learn something new; we have to **keep practicing**. That’s the only way to truly make use of what we’ve learned.

## Final Thoughts

Never be afraid to try new things! Learning new technologies and applying them through real projects is the best way to grow as a developer. If you're thinking about learning **Next.js**, **just start today!**
